# 2D Boxes Script

### About

This Universal 2D Boxes Script draws a square around the opponent which uses math to size itself correctly.
You can enable / disable the squares by pressing Q. You can also change this keybind inside the script.
You can also edit different settings about the square, such as color appearance, thickness, transparency and you can enable team check as well.
